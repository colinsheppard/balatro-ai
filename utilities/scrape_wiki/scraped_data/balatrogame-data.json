Instead of being included in Decks and played alongside standard cards, Jokers are obtained through the Shop and occasionally other means, and are held in the player's dedicated Joker slots until the player sells them or they are destroyed. Players usually start with five Joker slots, but can lose or gain slots in some circumstances. Jokers possess unique effects that can synergize, and a strong combination of Jokers is typically essential for the player to defeat Blinds at higher Antes. As of update 1.0.1o-FULL, there are 150 total Jokers of varying rarities, with 105 unlocked from the start and 45 unlockable through specific conditions. Various editions displayed in the Collection.Jokers can be enhanced with one of four different Editions, resulting in higher shop costs but adding an additional effect: In higher stakes, Jokers can also appear with Eternal, Perishable, and/or Rental Stickers. Jokers have four different rarities, denoting how likely they are to appear in a given run: Common (61 Jokers), Uncommon (64 Jokers), Rare (20 Jokers), and Legendary (5 Jokers). In general, higher rarity Jokers can be more powerful, but when a Joker has no direct analogue of a lower rarity, it can be difficult to determine if it is \"better\". When generating Jokers at random, there is a 70% chance of generating a Common Joker, a 25% chance of generating an Uncommon Joker, and a 5% chance of generating a Rare Joker. A Legendary Joker can only appear from The Soul Spectral Card. Jokers have a number of key terms that are vital in understanding how they work. (also see Activation type and Activation sequence for additional information) Available Jokers show as Not Discovered in the player's Collection until they are obtained in the course of an unseeded run. Most locked Jokers in the Collection show the unlock condition, and in some cases will show how close the player is to fulfilling that condition. There are also five secret Legendary Jokers that cannot be bought in the store, and get unlocked when obtained through the Soul spectral card. More information on each Joker such as the detail of their interactions and exceptions can be found on that Joker's respective page. The Balatro Wiki sorts Jokers into seven types. In the table below, the Joker type is shown using the following symbols:"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Decks","title":"Decks","content":"The contents of an erratic 52 Cards Deck.Decks contain playing cards that are key to forming poker hands.

Focus on high scoring poker hands, such as Flushes, Straights, and Full Houses. This helps with gaining more money from remaining Hands. Some Jokers, such as Merry Andy, Burglar, or Drunkard can increase the earnings from Green Deck by providing more Discards or Hands. Some Jokers that gain strength from having low money, such as Credit Card and Vagabond, are great combinations with the Green Deck, as you already get $0 in interest regardless. Jokers that depend on avoiding Discards, such as Ramen, Delayed Gratification or Banner, become even better. The +Hands vouchers Grabber and Nacho Tong are slightly better than normal. The +Discards vouchers Wasteful and Recyclomancy are also slightly better than normal. Avoid To the Moon since the Green Deck does not generate interest. Jokers that depend on using Discards, such as Mystic Summit or Burnt Joker, become worse. Jokers that scale with Hands or Discards used, such as Green Joker, Square Joker or Castle, are a lot harder to use efficiently with Green Deck, as they also cost you money. Jokers that have an effect on the final hand of the round, such as Dusk and Acrobat, become a lot worse, as you lose all the money earned from your Hands. Avoid the interest vouchers Seed Money and Money Tree, as the Green Deck does not generate interest. However, for longer runs, taking these vouchers prevents them from reappearing in later Antes, which makes other vouchers appear more. Winning with only 1 Hand becomes very important with this Deck, as this will be your main source of income. Try to avoid using multiple Hands or Discards in a Blind. Avoid saving up a lot of money during the first Ante(s). Getting 1 or more strong Jokers at the start is more important and can help you get a lot of money in the subsequent rounds. Also try to get another source of income, like Golden Joker, Gold Cards, or Gold Seals. The color green is commonly associated with paper money, which is typically used for everyday spending and does not earn interest, unlike money held in a bank account."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Deck","title":"Black Deck","content":"It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace). The early game on the Black Deck is much more difficult than with any other deck, since with one less hand, 5 less cards can be seen, which makes building around 5-card hands more difficult, but smaller hands (such as High Card) can be even worse, since one can only play 3 of them per round (instead of 4). The −1 hand also results in one less dollar made at the end of the blind. The extra joker slot doesn't matter much in the early game, since it may take many rounds to actually fill and utilize that 6th joker slot, but if one can survive the tougher early game, then the extra joker slot provides a much higher ceiling for scoring in the late game. As the Black deck, you should be more willing to take temporary strength such as Popcorn, in order to stay alive. These are some jokers which benefit from the extra joker slot or -1 hand per round: Jokers which are worse on the Black deck include: Tarot Cards to pick : Vouchers to pick:"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Deck","title":"Magic Deck","content":"It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

You also start with the Telescope voucher, but one fewer consumable slot than usual. The Nebula Deck is strongest with 5-card hands such as Straights, as the larger hands get significantly more scaling from planet cards. Unfortunately, there are far more jokers which suffer from the -1 consumable slot than benefit from the Telescope voucher. For example:"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Deck","title":"Ghost Deck","content":"It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace). You also start with a Hex spectral card in your consumables. Spectral Cards can appear in the Shop when using this deck with a weight of 2, or about 7% for each slot in the Shop. There is no way to increase this weight, and buying Vouchers like Tarot/Planet Merchant increases the total weight, lowering the chance of Spectral Cards. To increase the chance of seeing Spectral Cards, get more slots in the Shop using Overstock/Overstock Plus vouchers, or make rerolls cheaper using Chaos the Clown or Reroll Surplus/Reroll Glut vouchers for example. All spectral Cards have the same chance of appearing in the shop, except for The Soul and Black Hole, as they can only be found in Booster Packs. Starting a run with the Ghost Deck gives you the Hex card, which adds Polychrome (X1.5 Mult) to one random joker, at the cost of destroying all others. To avoid accidentally destroying a valuable joker (especially in the early game, when money is always a major constraint), it's best to use the Hex card as soon as a good joker is found. This joker should preferably be a joker which you are likely to keep into late into the game, such as a scaling joker like Spare Trousers or a powerful joker such as Stuntman As such, the first joker obtained is of high importance, and it is worth considering restarting a run if no good candidates appear in the first couple of shops. Alternatively, the Hex card may be sold for $2, providing a small cash infuse. Although significantly lower than the Yellow Deck's $10 bonus, this may allow the player to purchase an early spectral card. If this option is taken, deck-modifying spectral cards should be prioritized. Ouija and Grim in particular can be seen as more valuable than the starting Hex, as Polychrome's x1.5 Mult loses some of its significance after the mid-game, while these cards can set the player up for consistent Four/Five of a Kind hands in the late game. This deck is unique in that it can purchase the Deja Vu card from the shop, which grants a Red Seal to a chosen card. Unlike seeing it in Spectral packs, having the Deja Vu in the consumable slot means that it can be saved to go onto any card in your deck. This can make certain strategies far more reliable. Most notably, getting a Red Seal King with the Baron joker is many times easier on the Ghost deck than with any other deck. You can then use the Aura card to make this Red Seal card even stronger, then get a Purple Seal and put it on a card of the same rank, and then use the Cryptid card can then make 2 copies of the Red/Purple Seal card, allowing the entire deck to be built around this one card. It can also purchase the Cryptid card directly from the shop, which can be duplicated with Perkeo. Combined with Baron and Mime, this creates an Endless build that can reach naneinf. On any other deck, one would need to use Sixth Sense or Séance to obtain a Cryptid in the consumable slot. This strategy makes the Ghost deck one of the most reliable decks for getting far in Endless mode, though this build does require more Cryptids than the Plasma Deck. Spectral cards typically provide \"high risk, high reward\" effects that can drastically change the player's circumstances mid-run. Therefore, to take full advantage of the Ghost Deck's ability, it is best to avoid extreme specialization early in the run. However, later into the run, using the Deja Vu, Cryptid and Aura cards can allow entire strategies be build around a single, powerful card. Chaos the Clown gives 1 free reroll, increasing the likelihood of encountering spectral cards. Perkeo allows for the creation of essentially infinite copies of a spectral card, potentially completely breaking the game."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_Deck","title":"Abandoned Deck","content":"The Abandoned Deck contains cards numbered 2 through 10 and aces of the four suits, but is missing all Face Cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks). This brings its total card count down to 40 instead of the normal 52, the lowest starting card count out of any deck in the game. This Deck's smaller size leads to a much higher rate of drawing Pairs, Straights and Three of a Kind, even in the early game. The lack of face cards in the Abandoned Deck means that the average chip value of a hand is significantly lower than that of any other 52 card deck. If you can overcome this early weakness of the deck, you are significantly better off for late game than the other starting decks. Note: The absence of face cards wouldn't make a straight between an Ace card and cards numbered 10, 9, 8, and 7 possible."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Checkered_Deck","title":"Checkered Deck","content":"The Deck is a standard 52 card deck, except with each Club replaced by an equivalent Spade, and each Diamond replaced by a Heart.

Paint Brush allows a Flush to be made each time a hand is drawn, as long as no Club, Diamond, or Stone cards have been added to the deck. This Deck works best with Jokers that boost Heart and Spade cards, along with Jokers that reward flushes."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Zodiac_Deck","title":"Zodiac Deck","content":"It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

Note that your odds of finding a Joker in each shop is slightly higher using the Zodiac Deck than using a normal deck without any vouchers. Given Overstock's third shop card slot, Zodiac typically generates about 1.53 jokers per shop roll. A normal deck with only two shop card slots typically generates about 1.43 jokers per shop roll."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Painted_Deck","title":"Painted Deck","content":"It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

This is a significantly higher number and is offset by having Blind sizes twice as high when playing this deck. In fact, the hand score will always be higher after balancing (except in the case that its Chips and Mult are equal). The hand score is calculated as ⌊ Chips + Multiplier 2 ⌋ 2 { displaystyle { displaystyle left lfloor { frac {{ text{Chips}}+{ text{Multiplier}}}{2}} right rfloor ^{2}}} . It contains the usual 52 cards that a normal deck of cards includes: four suits, each with 13 cards (2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace). You want to aim for the highest raw number boosts to Chips and Mult. Since Chips start off at a higher number, most Jokers and Consumables boost Chips with a larger raw number than Mult (e.g. Bonus Card's +30 Chips vs Mult Card's +4 Mult). This is roughly balanced on other decks, but on the Plasma Deck, Chips and Mult equally contribute to the hand score, so using cards with large +Chips will result in a much higher score. In a normal deck, focusing on only XMult leads to a non-optimal distribution, which is fixed with the Plasma Deck and can result in much higher final scores with identical builds and the same hand. Chip boosters: However in later Antes, Chips only carry so far since they can only be additive in the base game (i.e. there are no XChips jokers in the base game). On the other hand, Mult can be multiplicative. While XMult is slow early on, with a high enough base Mult, this boost can be much greater than +Chips in the late game. In this example, one would need +4,000 Chips to match the power of adding a Polychrome: This makes the Plasma Deck one of the best decks for Endless mode, since even though the score requirement per Ante is doubled, by focusing on the XMult, the score one achieves is almost squared from the score achieved in any other deck. An Endless run example: 4 Polychrome Red Seal Glass 2s, Level 20 Four of a Kind, The Idol/ Blueprint/ Hack/ Brainstorm/ Perkeo, and Observatory with 115 Negative Mars cards On a regular deck, the resulting score is 662 Chips × 2.1e39 Mult = 1.4e42, which is enough to beat Ante 19. But on the Plasma Deck, the resulting score is ((662 Chips + 2.1e39 Mult) / 2)2 = (1.1e39)2 = 1.1e78, which is enough to beat Ante 24. This means, on the Plasma Deck, this build with the current setup has a headstart of 5 Antes. Playing many scoring cards is very efficient in this deck, example Two Pair: A,A,10,10 = 62 Chips and 2 Mult, which becomes 32 Chips and 32 Mult = 1,024 Stuntman is very useful with the Plasma Deck, because it produces an incredible amount of Chips and doesn't need time to scale. Wee Joker can also be incredibly useful with the Plasma Deck, however it requires a lot more time and focusing to reach an optimal level. Any Endless build can benefit from the Plasma Deck; Perkeo can be used for copying Planet cards for the Observatory voucher, where the amount of Planets needed is less than usual due to each Planet boosting the score by almost the square of the amount as on any other deck. Sixth Sense and Séance can generate a Cryptid in the consumable area, which can also be copied by Perkeo (for Baron/ Mime builds) — the amount of Cryptids needed is also less than usual, since each Cryptid boosts the score by almost the square of the amount as on any other deck. This is a case of the AM–GM inequality. Let Chips be C and Mult be M. Their difference is defined as D = C − M. Expanding D2, we get D2 = C2 + M2 − 2CM. The normal hand score, before balancing, is given as CM. Balanced Hand Score = ( C + M 2 ) 2 = C 2 + M 2 + 2 C M 4 = C 2 + M 2 − 2 C M + 4 C M 4 = C 2 + M 2 − 2 C M 4 + 4 C M 4 = D 2 4 + C M = ( C − M ) 2 4 + Normal Hand Score { displaystyle { begin{array}{lcl}{ text{Balanced Hand Score}}&=& left({ frac {C+M}{2}} right)^{2} &=&{ frac {C^{2}+M^{2}+2CM}{4}} &=&{ frac {C^{2}+M^{2}-2CM+4CM}{4}} &=&{ frac {C^{2}+M^{2}-2CM}{4}}+{ frac {4CM}{4}} &=&{ frac {D^{2}}{4}}+CM &=&{ frac { left(C-M right)^{2}}{4}}+{ text{Normal Hand Score}} end{array}}} Because (C − M)2 is always greater than or equal to zero, the balanced hand score will always be greater than or equal to the normal hand score. They will only be equal if C equals M, indicating the normal hand score was already balanced. This inequality is expressed as, ( C + M 2 ) 2 ≥ C M { displaystyle left({ frac {C+M}{2}} right)^{2} geq CM} which is a form of the AM-GM inequality. ◼ { textstyle blacksquare} Due to Plasma Deck's doubled Blind size, some hands are less effective at beating a large Blind when played on Plasma Deck. A hand's effectiveness can be measured as its score divided by the Blind size—like the Blind has an HP bar and a hand reduces it by a percentage. At worst, a hand can be twice as ineffective on Plasma Deck if its Chips and Mult are exactly equal, as balancing doesn't increase the score, yet the Blind size is doubled. Plasma Deck thus encourages the player to build towards heavily scaling either Chips or Mult—usually Mult as it scales faster with XMult effects. Otherwise, if the player had built towards having relatively balanced Chips and Mult, balancing again would not provide enough of a buff to overcome the doubled Blind size debuff, and the hand ends up being less effective, especially at larger blinds. Specifically, a hand's Mult has to be around 5.8x its Chips, or its Chips around 5.8x its Mult, for the hand to be as effective on Plasma Deck as on a normal-scoring deck. What follows is a proof: Let Chips be C and Mult be M. The normal hand score is given as CM, while the balanced hand score is given as ( C + M 2 ) 2 { textstyle left({ frac {C+M}{2}} right)^{2}} . The effectiveness of a given hand is measured as its score divided by the Blind size S. On a normal-scoring deck, this is measured as C M S { textstyle { frac {CM}{S}}} ; on Plasma Deck, it is measured as ( C + M ) 2 8 S { textstyle { frac {(C+M)^{2}}{8S}}} where the doubled Blind size 2S is accounted for. To find the Chips–Mult ratio C/M where a hand becomes equally effective on both decks, set the two measures equal: C M S = ( C + M ) 2 8 S 8 C M = ( C + M ) 2 8 C M = C 2 + M 2 + 2 C M 0 = C 2 + M 2 − 6 C M { displaystyle { begin{array}{rcl}{ frac {CM}{S}}&=&{ frac {(C+M)^{2}}{8S}} 8CM&=&(C+M)^{2} 8CM&=&C^{2}+M^{2}+2CM 0&=&C^{2}+M^{2}-6CM end{array}}} Solve for C using the quadratic formula, treating M as a constant: C = 6 M ± ( 6 M ) 2 − 4 M 2 2 = 6 M ± 36 M 2 − 4 M 2 2 = 6 M ± 32 M 2 2 = 6 M ± 4 2 M 2 = 3 M ± 2 2 M { displaystyle { begin{array}{rcl}C&=&{ frac {6M pm { sqrt {(6M)^{2}-4M^{2}}}}{2}} &=&{ frac {6M pm { sqrt {36M^{2}-4M^{2}}}}{2}} &=&{ frac {6M pm { sqrt {32M^{2}}}}{2}} &=&{ frac {6M pm 4{ sqrt {2}}M}{2}} &=&3M pm 2{ sqrt {2}}M end{array}}} The two solutions are approximately: C ≈ 5.828 M and C ≈ 0.172 M { displaystyle C approx 5.828M{ text{ and }}C approx 0.172M} These solutions are reciprocals of each other, which means either C/M ≈ 5.828 or M/C ≈ 5.828. ◼ { textstyle blacksquare}"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Erratic_Deck","title":"Erratic Deck","content":"This deck contains 52 cards like a normal deck, but the suits and ranks are completely randomized.

They are single-use items and disappear upon usage, but their effects remain for the rest of the run. They modify different aspects of the run, such as enhancing cards in the deck or boosting the base multiplier for different hands. Consumables have the same height as Jokers and playing cards, but are slightly narrower in width. If directly offered in the shop, the player has the choice to buy and use the card immediately, or to just buy it and hold on to it for future use. Buying and using the card immediately activates its effect, unless it targets the playing cards from the deck, in which case it cannot be used until a hand is available to apply the effect on. Until then, all purchased consumables remain in the consumable slot. 2 consumable slots are available initially, and each consumable occupies 1 slot. Consumables generated as a result of other cards activating also appear in the consumable slots, unless no more space is available, and any attempt to generate or buy more consumables is disabled. A consumable occupying a slot can be sold (as always, for lower than the ordinary cost in the shop) at any time to vacate that slot.

The Vouchers are split into 16 pairs, each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. Within each pair is a weaker \"initial\" Voucher (costs $10) and a stronger \"dependent\" Voucher (costs an additional $10) that generally enhances the effect of the former. No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an \"initial\" Voucher can the player then claim the \"dependent\" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock.

There are 18 different cards with no unlock conditions, but they can usually only be found in booster packs and not individually (unless with Ghost Deck). It is possible to spawn Spectral Cards via certain Jokers, or, in certain circumstances, purchase them in the shop, in which case they will take up a Consumable slot. The chance of each Spectral card appearing is equal, except for The Soul and Black Hole.

For Tarot and Spectral packs, a hand of playing cards is also dealt from the player's deck to apply the effects on. Usually only one consumable option can be used, and the rest disappear after the player has used that card. If none of the options are appealing or suitable, the player can also choose to skip without using any card, and they are all discarded as well. Each category of booster comes in three sizes - normal, jumbo and mega - with each providing more choice than the previous one. Within each size, there can be variety in the artwork, but the behavior of these packs stays the same. When drawing Booster Packs for the shop, not all boosters are equally likely.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

There are 24 Tags available, and you can hold multiple at once until they're used. The chance for each Tag to appear is the same. The same Tag can appear multiple times during a run and even during the same Ante. However, during Ante 1, the Negative, Standard, Meteor, Buffoon, Handy, Garbage, Ethereal, Top-up, and Orbital cannot be encountered. Five tags also have a hidden unlock requirement: for the Rare tag you need to have discovered Blueprint (which means winning 1 run), and for the Negative, Foil, Holographic and Polychrome Tags you need to have discovered their respective editions.

The list of poker hands can be accessed by pressing \"Run Info\".Poker Hands are sets of between one and five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are usually upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers. These Poker Hands will not appear in the Run Info screen until you've played them at least once, after which they will show up on the info menu, and their respective Planet Cards will be obtainable only during the current run. These Poker Hands will also be upgraded by Black Hole, even before they are unlocked.

The Shop is only accessible after defeating a Small Blind, Big Bind, or Boss Blind. By default, the shop sells: The random cards sold are drawn with the default weights: This can be rewritten to the approximate chances of each card: With the Magic Trick Voucher, playing cards are given a weight of 4; the Illusion Voucher makes playing cards enhanced 40% of the time, editioned 20% of the time, and is unaffected by Hone/Glow Up. The Tarot Merchant Voucher raises the Tarot Card weight to 9.6 while the Tarot Tycoon Voucher raises the weight to 32. The Planet Merchant and Planet Tycoon Vouchers work in the same way. With the Ghost Deck, Spectral Cards can appear with a weight of 2. The number of available random cards can be increased by the Overstock and Overstock Plus vouchers, which increases the number of sold cards to 3 and 4 respectively. You may pay money to reroll the shop an unlimited number of times, removing any of the remaining random cards and replacing them with 2 new random cards. The reroll cost starts at $5 and increases $1 each time you reroll, resetting to $5 upon entering a new shop. However, rerolling the shop does not restock Booster Packs or the Voucher. Booster packs only restock upon entering a new shop, and the Voucher restocks after defeating the boss blind. All items have a buy cost (purchase price) and a sell cost (selling value), which are recalculated every time the player interacts with the item. These follow consistent formulas for calculating them, with some exceptions applied due to other in-game items. The total buy cost of an item normally consists of its base cost, an edition cost (if it has an Edition), applying discounts (if certain Vouchers are purchased), and rounding any fractions half down. The minimum buy cost of an item is usually $1, with some special exceptions. The total sell cost of an item consists of the total buy cost halved, and rounded down. The minimum sell cost of an item is always $1.All items have a base cost, even Legendary Jokers (which can't be found in the shop). Playing Cards can only be found in the Shop after purchasing the Magic Trick Voucher, and Spectral Cards can only be found when playing with the Ghost Deck. Jokers and Playing Cards (with Illusion) can have Editions, which raises their price in the shop and their sell value. Consumables can have a Negative Edition when generated by Perkeo, which raises their sell value, but they can never be found in the shop with an edition. After purchasing the Clearance Sale and Liquidation Vouchers, a 25% or 50% discount is applied to the buy cost of all items in the shop. This also indirectly affects the sell cost of all items. After multiplying by this number, the result is then rounded half down (for example, 8.5 is rounded to 8). This cannot result in a price of $0 or lower, and the buy cost will always be a minimum of $1 after the Discount step. The total buy cost is recalculated from scratch (applying any vouchers bought in-between, any special case that changes the buy cost, etc), divided by 2, and floored (rounded down). This also cannot result in a sell price of $0 or lower, and it will always be a minimum of $1."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Gameplay_rules","title":"Gameplay rules","content":"Balatro gameplay has no definitive stages, instead each run has multiple rounds of boss blinds that have to be defeated by achieving a certain score through playing various poker hands. *Information below is based on the latest version of Balatro (0.9.0q-DEMO) unless otherwise stated. Upon clicking the play button, an interface will emerge with three tabs at the top (New Run, Continue and Daily Run).The Continue tab displaying various information about the unfinished gameThe New Run tab displaying different stake and deck options and the custom seedA game file displaying potential stake difficulties; the base difficulty White Stake is seen at the top leftThe interface defaults to Continue if there is a previous unfinished run, and displays the stake difficulty, deck type and various other information about that run. The player continues from where they previously left off if they click on \"play\". If there are no previously unfinished runs, or if the player wishes to start an entirely new run, the interface switches to New Run instead, where different stake difficulty (only White Stake difficulty so far) and starting deck (3 out of 15 are available in the demo) options are available. There is also the option to play a seeded run where the player can input a custom seed. The seed pre-determines all the boss blinds and shop options available in that run but disables discovering new items from the collection and score statistics are disregarded (joker, and consumable stats still track your seeded games). Versions prior to the demo unlocked higher difficulty New Game + options upon a successful run that defeated the final boss blind, with each higher difficulty setting adding more \"+\" signs and faster ante scaling. A tutorial run is loaded if the player has never played the game before, where Jimbo, the game's mascot joker, will explain the various interfaces of the game while leading the player through an example run [please verify]. The Daily Run tab is a recent addition of the demo version, but no playable interface has been implemented so far. When clicked, it displays a description of potential features of the new game mode, promising daily challenge runs with unsellable Eternal Jokers, custom starting decks, unique rulesets and a competitive ranking system. Once the player begins a run, they are presented with the first set of three blinds: the Small Blind, the Big Blind, and the Boss Blind. The first two of these can be skipped to receive Tags that provide a boost, but the Boss Blind must be defeated to move on to the next Ante. To defeat a blind, the player must select cards from their hand to play poker hands and score chips. A given number of discards are available to assist with creating better hands. If the player is unable to reach the blind's chip requirement in the allotted number of hands, the run is lost, and the player must restart from Ante 1. Upon reaching the chip requirement, the round ends and the player receives money: a set amount depending on the type of blind defeated, plus $1 extra for each remaining hand, plus $1 interest for every $5 the player already has. This money can be used in the Shop to buy Jokers and Consumables to improve the run. When Ante 8 is completed, the player wins the run, and is allowed to either start a new one or continue in Endless Mode, letting the player keep going for as long as they can before the blinds become too difficult to defeat."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Collection","title":"Collection","content":"A completed collectionThe Collection contains a list of all items that the player will encounter in gameplay, varying from boss blinds to booster packs. Below are links to the various pages concerning each category of collectibles. Obtaining a collectible card, whether it be via buying it from the shop, obtaining it from a purple or blue seal, or having it created, discovers it. Some collectible cards have prerequisites before being able to be found in the shop and thus those prerequisites need to be fulfilled before they can be discovered. Decks are discovered either by discovering a certain amount of the collection or by beating a run on a certain deck or stake. Vouchers are discovered by buying them in the shop. As with the cards, some vouchers have prerequisites which need to be fulfilled before they appear in the shop, but unlike the cards the former of the voucher pairs are needed in order to find the latter of the pairs. Editions are discovered by having a playing card or joker with them on it. Tags are discovered by skipping a blind with that tag as the reward, or, in the case of the Double Tag, beating a boss blind with the Anaglyph Deck. Boss blinds are discovered by beating the boss. Since some only spawn at certain antes or above, some can be harder that others to discover.

When a hand is played, effects will activate in the following orders. (Some Jokers may have different parts trigger at different stages: for example, Wee Joker gain chips 'on scored' and adds chips to total 'independently'). See Activation Type for a full list of when different Jokers activate. Almost all card arrangement problems stem from the order of additive Mult and multiplicative Mult. According to the law of distribution, the +Mult activating before the xMult gives a higher score. For example, a hand normally scoring 40 x 4 is played and a +4 Mult Joker and a X2 Mult Ramen is present. If the Joker is on the left of Ramen, the hand will score 40 x ((4+4)x2) = 640 chips whereas the reversed placement will only score 40 x ((4x2)+4) = 480 chips. This concept applies to the order of cards played and in hand as well as Jokers. For a higher score, the player may arrange in the following ways: In case the player wanted a lower score for purposes like scaling Jokers, they may put +Mult to the right of xMult. Some cards with special abilities can give different outcomes when arranged differently."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Achievements","title":"Achievements","content":"In most versions of Balatro, additional Achievements, or Trophies on PlayStation, are available for meeting certain conditions.

The wiki can be edited by anyone, but there is a set of rules all editors should normally follow."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:_naneinf","title":"Guide: naneinf","content":"There are several documented methods on YouTube to achieving a Naneinf score, which all require specific set-ups that use the Baron and Mime Jokers, with differing methods for achieving a large hand size of Kings modified with a red seal and Steel. This method can be performed at any stake for any unseeded run (although White Stake is highly recommended), and does not require any Legendary Jokers. This method requires the Plasma Deck since this Deck squares the average of your Chip and Mult scores, enabling higher scoring. Captured from Balatro Calculator45 red seal Steel Kings in hand while using Plasma Deck, Baron + Mime, and 4 copiers (e.g. 2 Blueprints and 2 Brainstorms) to create at least 19 hands with Burglar against The Serpent. This scores over e308 (the Naneinf threshold). Starting with 5 slots, gain +1 from the Antimatter, and +1 from using Ectoplasm on a key Joker. Runs start with 8, and you can gain +2 from the Paint Brush and Palette vouchers, but lose -1 from Ectoplasm. Do not use a second Ectoplasm, since this further reduces hand size by -2. Runs start with 4 hands per Blind, but this can be increased by +2 from the Grabber and Nacho Tong vouchers. Burglar copied 4 times generates 15 more hands, giving a total of 21 hands for your Naneinf scoring round. Hieroglyph is safe to use as long as you have at least Grabber. This non-Finisher Boss Blind allows you to draw 3 cards and add them to your hand after playing or discarding even just one card. Effectively you can increase your hand size by double the number of hands you have minus one (the last hand which you need to play to score), e.g. (21-1) x 2 = 40, giving you 40 + 8 red seal Steel Kings in your hand = 48. The Retcon voucher is essential to re-roll for this Boss, since it is not guaranteed to appear when you need it. Make sure you have enough money to re-roll multiple times ($10 per roll). Since the Naneinf technique requires you to use The Serpent to increase your hand size to over 44, and this Boss is only available on non-Finisher Boss rounds (i.e., not on rounds 8, 16, 24, or 32), you need to time your Naneinf play appropriately. You should aim to do this after the point at which abusing the Serpent does not beat the score target prematurely (hence finishing the Blind without achieving Naneinf), but before the Ante scores get too high. This happens after Ante 24 (since the required score is higher than the lowest score you can achieve with Burglar adding multiple red seal Steel Kings in hand and one uncopied Baron + Mime). To get past the Finisher Boss on Ante 24 you must beat scores higher than e77 by using DNA to increase your hand size by +5, which allows you to reach scores of e87. To progress past ante 25 you must skip all Small and Big Blinds and re-roll for The Serpent boss. The limit however is ante 32 which is a Finisher Boss, and hence the Serpent cannot be used, and DNA is not enough to beat the score. In practice, Naneinf with this method is most easily achievable between Antes 25 and 31, giving you 7 attempts at finding a Burglar between rounds. This set up requires specific Vouchers in order to be successful. Which voucher appears at the start of each round is largely up to chance, but you can work around this by collecting a number of Double Tags to store up for use in the late game. Collected Double Tags add up in your sidebar and can be used to copy the Voucher Tag that randomly appears on Small or Big Blinds. You can accumulate Double Tags in two ways: skipping Blinds that give a Double Tag, or buying and selling Diet Cola. However, the Voucher skip tag is not guaranteed to show up at all, so you should also make sure to buy the essential Vouchers whenever you see them during your run. These vouchers do not help with getting Naneinf, but can still be bought so they will not reappear in the Shop, making it more likely to get one of other essential Vouchers over the next rounds. These vouchers all dilute the cards shown in the shop with items you don't necessarily need. Buying these Vouchers lowers the chance of finding specific Jokers and Tarot cards that you actually need when the time comes to do extensive re-rolling. This method relies on Perkeo's ability to generate unlimited negative copies of consumable cards. The set up and strategy is essentially the same for the Baron + Mime + Burglar set up above, except for the scoring method, in which the player should generate red seal Steel Kings by using multiple negative Cryptids created by Perkeo. Since Perkeo is a Legendary Joker, and hence quite rare, it is not always possible to use it to achieve Naneinf on any given unseeded run. This Naneinf technique can in theory be done using any Deck, however the Ghost Deck is recommended since Spectral Cards such as Cryptid can appear naturally in the shop. In theory, Naneinf is achievable using Perkeo to create multiple negative copies of Pluto and relying on Observatory to provide x1.5 Mult per Pluto card. Using the red seal Steel King set up above, but with only 8 Kings in hand, this would require 1582 negative Plutos with a traditional scoring deck. This is practically impossible since Perkeo can only create one Pluto per round until copying Jokers are found, and there are only 113 rounds until Ante 39 assuming none are skipped. Even with Perkeo and 4 copying Jokers from the very first round, a player would only be able to generate 566 negative Plutos by Ante 39. With the Plasma Deck, the requirement would be 718 negative Plutos, which still remains practically unachievable, since this would require 6 copying Jokers and a Perkeo all in round 1. Modded runs have been able to achieve this, however. After achieving Naneinf the game will allow you to continue back to the Shop and select another round to continue playing. However, once you play your next card the game will crash, since it cannot use Naneinf as a real number for which to compare against any new scores generated. The error reads: Oops! Something went wrong: functions/misc_functions.lua:1019: attempt to compare nil with numberImmediately after achieving Naneinf the highest hand score displayed in the stats menu will read 'naneinf', but after exiting and re-loading the game the highest hand score will be reset to zero."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Sock_and_Buskin","title":"Sock and Buskin","content":""},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Joker","title":"Ancient Joker","content":"This effect can vary from incredibly powerful to practically irrelevant. Ancient Joker can carry a run into the late Antes, but only if the deck is built specifically to take advantage of its effect. All Flush hands benefit greatly (though inconsistently) from Ancient Joker, since they will trigger its effect the maximum number of times compared to other hands. Unlike other Flush-based builds, it's best to not centralize around one suit, as Ancient Joker will only select it one in three times (1/4th on the first selection), and never more than half of all times.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here.

All Flush hands benefit greatly (though inconsistently) from Ancient Joker, since they will trigger its effect the maximum number of times compared to other hands. Unlike other Flush-based builds, it's best to not centralize around one suit, as Ancient Joker will only select it one in three times (1/4th on the first selection), and never more than half of all times.

The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated.

This Joker cannot receive the Eternal sticker. Gros Michel is essentially a must take in the early Antes; with it, most Two Pairs (16 combined rank or higher), any Three of a Kind, or any higher ranked hand is guaranteed to clear each Blind of Ante 1, and any of the common 5-card hands (Straight, Flush, and Full House) can clear up to the Big Blind of Ante 2 on any difficulty without help, provided the chip value is at least 79. Seeing it early also increases the odds of destroying it early, and gaining quick access to Cavendish, a cheap and guaranteed source of Multiplicative Mult, which is essentially mandatory to clear the later Antes on any difficulty past Red Stake. This Joker requires no real accommodation to be effective, and synergizes equally well with all starting decks. This Joker unconditionally adds Mult, and can be effective with any hand as a result. Building around this wonder fruit in the long term is a fool's errand, since it is bound to disappear sooner or later. However, any build, regardless of synergy, will be happy to pick it up; not only does it provide a powerful bonus before expiry, but exhausting it unlocks the even more powerful Cavendish. Thus, it can supplement any build. However, if it remains for a few too many rounds, it may be necessary to ditch its secret potential in order to pick up a Joker that is more immediately helpful. Avoid adding any editions to it if possible, as they will be lost when it goes extinct; if you obtain The Wheel of Fortune Tarot Card, or the Ectoplasm Spectral Card, hold onto them until this Joker destroys itself, in order to maximize their value, or consider selling them to improve your run immediately.

Cards which are discarded or debuffed by certain Blinds do not trigger this effect. The Painted Deck has a larger hand size, making this joker easier to use. If the player builds their deck to be mostly Kings, it is best to level up smaller hands (such as High Card or Pair) to keep as many Kings in hand as possible. The Serpent is by far the most popular boss blind to go against a Baron build thanks to the ability to temporarily increase handsize. This Joker should be avoided when playing the Abandoned Deck as it does not naturally contain any Kings. The Plant can potentially be a run killer as debuffed Kings renders Baron totally useless. On first glance, Baron might seem like a small amount of Mult. However, what makes Baron so incredibly strong is that every King or Steel card in hand multiplies your score exponentially. For example, one King only multiplies your score by 1.5x. But two Kings multiplies it by 1.5x twice, which is a 2.25x increase. If an ideal card for Baron is held in hand (a steel King with a red seal), it will produce x1.5^4 = ~x5.1 Mult. With Mime, this increases to x1.5^6 = ~x11.4 Mult; with one Blueprint/Brainstorm copying Mime, it increases to x1.5^8 = ~x25.6 Mult, and with two cards copying each Mime and Baron it rises further to x1.5^12 = ~x130 Mult. If a player manages to find these four Jokers and enough steel Kings with red seals to fill a hand, they will be able to play far into Endless mode. For example, with a Hand size of eight, the base Mult would be multiplied by ~x619 trillion; with a Hand size of nine this increases to ~80 quadrillion; and with a Hand size of ten it further increases to ~10 quintillion (1.0x10^19). With some base chips and mult, this is enough to finish the first 16 Antes. Using Plasma Deck, players can achieve the elusive Naneinf score. The formula of total x1.5s per card is (x1.5s each trigger) x (total trigger times). Since multiple retriggers stack additively, for each red seal steel King in your hand, the formula becomes (1 steel + number of Baron equivalents) x (1 base + 1 red seal + number of Mime equivalents). If the player can arrange Blueprints/Brainstorms to copy these Jokers, they can reach the best possible score by having 1 more Baron equivalents than Mime equivalents. For lower antes, Shoot the Moon or Raised Fist are some of the best ways to get mult that scores before your jokers score. However, because cards in hand trigger from left to right, you must physically move your Queens/lowest rank card to the left of your Kings, in order for their mult to be multiplied."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_(Joker)","title":"Baron","content":"Baron is a Rare Multiplicative Mult Joker that provides a X1.5 Mult for each King in the player's hand after playing a hand.

With Mime, this increases to x1.5^6 = ~x11.4 Mult; with one Blueprint/Brainstorm copying Mime, it increases to x1.5^8 = ~x25.6 Mult, and with two cards copying each Mime and Baron it rises further to x1.5^12 = ~x130 Mult. If a player manages to find these four Jokers and enough steel Kings with red seals to fill a hand, they will be able to play far into Endless mode. For example, with a Hand size of eight, the base Mult would be multiplied by ~x619 trillion; with a Hand size of nine this increases to ~80 quadrillion; and with a Hand size of ten it further increases to ~10 quintillion (1.0x10^19). With some base chips and mult, this is enough to finish the first 16 Antes. Using Plasma Deck, players can achieve the elusive Naneinf score. The formula of total x1.5s per card is (x1.5s each trigger) x (total trigger times). Since multiple retriggers stack additively, for each red seal steel King in your hand, the formula becomes (1 steel + number of Baron equivalents) x (1 base + 1 red seal + number of Mime equivalents). If the player can arrange Blueprints/Brainstorms to copy these Jokers, they can reach the best possible score by having 1 more Baron equivalents than Mime equivalents. For lower antes, Shoot the Moon or Raised Fist are some of the best ways to get mult that scores before your jokers score. However, because cards in hand trigger from left to right, you must physically move your Queens/lowest rank card to the left of your Kings, in order for their mult to be multiplied."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Card","title":"Card Modifiers","content":"Modifiers are upgrades that can be applied to cards that provide many different benefits, such as improved scoring capability, money generation, or card manipulation. There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

Creates a Tarot card when discarded (Must have room) Can be from discards by the player, or from the automatic discard of The Hook boss blind. See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers. Illusion is bugged such that it never spawns seals, and is unaffected by Hone/Glow Up. Enhancements Editions Seals"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Cards","title":"Card Ranks","content":"Card ranks are the thirteen values that can be found on a playing card in Balatro. These values are aces, the number cards 2 to 10, and the three face cards: Jacks, Queens and Kings. Each card also has a suit. In most games with playing cards, an Ace can be treated 'low' or 'high'. If treated low, it usually represents a 1. If treated high, it usually represents a card better than a face card. For example, in Blackjack, an Ace can be valued at 1 or 11, at the player's choice. In Balatro, the Ace can be considered as 'low' or 'high' in a Straight, but it always scores as 'high' to provide 11 Chips. \"Face cards\" is a grouping term for Jacks, Queens and Kings. Usually in most games, a King is better than a Queen, a Queen is better than a Jack, and all are better than number cards. In Balatro, all face cards provide 10 Chips each when scored. From Update 1.0.1g, it is possible to customise the artwork of face cards with Friends of Jimbo from other games. Number cards usually carry the value of their number, unless modified by tarot cards to add Card Modifiers or modified by joker effects. They are sometimes called 'pip' cards, as each icon printed on them is a pip. In Balatro, the number cards provide chips equal to their value unless modified, for example, a 7 card provides 7 Chips when scored. Note that cards are not scored when not required for the hand. \"Even cards\" are cards with a rank that can be divided by 2 into a whole number. In Balatro, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are considered even. \"Odd cards\" are cards with a rank that cannot be divided by 2 into a whole number. In Balatro, Ace, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are considered odd."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_Card","title":"Baseball Card","content":"Importantly, Baseball Card's effect doesn't trigger from a \"minimum\" rarity requirement of Uncommon; it only triggers specifically from Uncommon Jokers.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker.

A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers).

Jokers that reduce hand size, like Stuntman or Merry Andy has slight synergy with Blue Joker since less cards are drawn to hand means more cards remaining in the deck, increasing bonus chips each hand played. Blue Joker has anti-synergy with Erosion."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Seal","title":"Card Modifiers","content":"Modifiers are upgrades that can be applied to cards that provide many different benefits, such as improved scoring capability, money generation, or card manipulation. There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop.

See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers.

To unlock a stake for a deck, you must complete a run using the highest currently unlocked stake. Progression through the different stakes is unique to each starting deck, meaning that you must unlock each stake individually for each deck. The 8 stakes, listed in the order that they are unlocked. Note that each stake applies the modifiers of all previous stakes. The first Soul card in a Gold seed will give a Legendary Joker that doesn't yet have a Gold Sticker, which will help with the Completionist++ achievement. Undocumented"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Sticker","title":"Stickers","content":"All of the different Stickers as they can be found in the files.Balatro has 11 Stickers that can be applied to Jokers or Decks. Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker. There are eight Stake Stickers, which are listed here in the same order as their respective Stakes."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blueprint","title":"Blueprint","content":"Blueprint is a Rare Effect Joker that copies the effect of the Joker to its immediate right.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity).

The price will go up $1 per Reroll as normal. The Jokers created cannot have Stickers, like Eternal/Perishable/Rental, even at higher stakes. Guaranteed to give at least $5, as it includes the Blind skipped to gain this tag. The hand can be a secret hand if it has already been played in this run. If your balance is negative your money is not doubled, instead giving you $0 and essentially wasting the tag.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit. X2 Mult 1 in 4 chance to destroy card after all scoring is finished +50 Chips No rank or suit Card always scores 1 in 5 chance for +20 Mult 1 in 15 chance to win $20 (Both can trigger on the same turn) (Can only be acquired through Perkeo) Retrigger this card 1 time In addition to when being scored in a poker hand, this also includes in-hand effects such as lowest-value card for Raised Fist, in-hand Kings from Baron, Steel card multipliers, or money earned from Reserved Parking. Creates a Tarot card when discarded (Must have room) Can be from discards by the player, or from the automatic discard of The Hook boss blind. See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers. Illusion is bugged such that it never spawns seals, and is unaffected by Hone/Glow Up. Enhancements Editions Seals"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Ranks","title":"Card Ranks","content":"Card ranks are the thirteen values that can be found on a playing card in Balatro. These values are aces, the number cards 2 to 10, and the three face cards: Jacks, Queens and Kings. Each card also has a suit. In most games with playing cards, an Ace can be treated 'low' or 'high'. If treated low, it usually represents a 1. If treated high, it usually represents a card better than a face card. For example, in Blackjack, an Ace can be valued at 1 or 11, at the player's choice. In Balatro, the Ace can be considered as 'low' or 'high' in a Straight, but it always scores as 'high' to provide 11 Chips. \"Face cards\" is a grouping term for Jacks, Queens and Kings. Usually in most games, a King is better than a Queen, a Queen is better than a Jack, and all are better than number cards. In Balatro, all face cards provide 10 Chips each when scored. From Update 1.0.1g, it is possible to customise the artwork of face cards with Friends of Jimbo from other games. Number cards usually carry the value of their number, unless modified by tarot cards to add Card Modifiers or modified by joker effects. They are sometimes called 'pip' cards, as each icon printed on them is a pip. In Balatro, the number cards provide chips equal to their value unless modified, for example, a 7 card provides 7 Chips when scored. Note that cards are not scored when not required for the hand. \"Even cards\" are cards with a rank that can be divided by 2 into a whole number. In Balatro, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are considered even. \"Odd cards\" are cards with a rank that cannot be divided by 2 into a whole number. In Balatro, Ace, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are considered odd."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Sharp","title":"Card Sharp","content":"Strong 5-card hands like Flush, Straight, Full House, etc... benefit the most from Card Sharp, provided they can be played at least twice per blind.

A standard deck consists of 4 suits, with 13 cards of different rank in each suite. The suits are found in the following order: the Spade suit, the Heart suit, the Club suit, and the Diamond suit, shown from top to bottom in the visual deck display, and left to right in your hand when sorting by suit (while the rank acts as the tiebreaker). This is true even when the cards are drawn face down, allowing you to guess at a card's suit. Each suit contains an Ace followed by King, Queen, and Jack, and then 10-2, shown left to right both in the visual deck display and in your hand when sorted by suit. When your hand is sorted by rank, the ranks are ordered from left to right, (A, KQJ, 10-2) while the suits act as the tiebreaker. This is true even when the cards are face down, allowing you to guess at a card's rank. (For example, in rank sort, an Ace of Diamonds will be sorted to the right of an Ace of Spades, but to the left of a King of any suit.) Some decks in Balatro (such as the Checkered Deck or the Erratic Deck) use a different distribution of cards, and some consumables and Jokers can manipulate the suits in a deck. Wild Cards are considered to be every suit simultaneously, meaning they can benefit from multiple suit-related Jokers (and be penalized by any suit-related Boss Blind). However, for Jokers such as Flower Pot and Seeing Double, each Wild Card will only count as one suit at a time. The Spade suit is one of four suits in Balatro. It is one of two black suits, the other being the Club suit. The Spade suit is colored dark blue-black. Jokers that directly synergize with the Spade suit: Jokers that affect the Spade suit as well as other suits: The Heart suit is one of four suits in Balatro.

Due to the integral Activation Sequence, Joker effects with different activation types can interact very differently. Joker effects that activate immediately when you play cards, and before scoring. These are often scaling abilities: for example Square Joker's scaling, Runner's scaling, Vampire's scaling, Space Joker, DNA, and Midas Mask. These effects benefit from playing more required hands or cards. Note that these affect unscored cards. Joker effects that activate on every scored card from your played hand: for example Wrathful Joker, Odd Todd, The Idol, Wee Joker's scaling, and Dusk. Since they activate on card triggers, they would benefit greatly from card retriggers (except other retriggers), and be hindered by cards not scored or debuffed. Joker effects that activate on certain cards held in hand: for example Raised Fist, Baron, Reserved Parking, and Mime. They benefit from retriggers from Mime (except for itself) and are affected by debuffs. Joker effects that happen after all the cards in hand are scored: for example Joker, Sly Joker, Steel Joker. Editions on Jokers like foil, holographic or polychrome also activate during this phase. These Jokers do not get affected by retriggers or card debuffs in most cases. Joker effects that activate on certain other Jokers. Only Baseball Card activates this way as of now. Joker effects that activate on discarding certain cards or poker hands. There are a few categories: Burnt Joker and Faceless Joker rely on discarding poker hands; Castle's scaling and Mail-In Rebate rely on discarding specific cards. Benefits from having more discards, but doesn’t have much synergy besides that. Jokers that belong to multiple other categories, such as Runner belonging to both \"On Played\" for scaling, and \"Independent\" for adding chips to the total score. Some non-scoring Jokers fit in none of the above categories, mostly Economy Jokers like Golden Joker, or Effect Jokers like Four Fingers. Passively active Jokers, since they never specifically activate, cannot be copied by Blueprint or Brainstorm. Since on-scored Jokers and on-held Jokers always activate before independent Jokers, the xMult from on-scored Jokers and +Mult from independent Jokers don’t activate in the optimal order. For example, Droll Joker cannot benefit from Ancient Joker when a flush with the selected suit is played. Extensive list of Activation type for each Joker.

Black Deck's extra Joker slot is very helpful, as one can still have five Jokers while scaling Dagger. Inversely, Painted Deck's reduced Joker amount is very bad to combo with Dagger, as you will only have three Jokers while scaling Dagger. The Anaglyph Deck is occasionally a good choice as the Double Tag can provide lots of economic buff when presented, however skipping a blind means skipping a level of scaling. This Joker can sometimes make it more difficult to change your deck due to needing a constant supply of money to fuel its destruction of other Jokers. As a result, it might be best to prioritize easier-to-play hands. However, the hand you play doesn't really matter, as the Mult Dagger provides will always apply. Jokers that can add sell value to cards can increase dagger's effect, such as Gift Card, which increases all of your jokers' sell value by $1 per round; and Egg, which gains $3 of sell value per round. Swashbuckler, which also benefits from higher sell values, can act as a sort of mini-Dagger until you find it. Ceremonial Dagger is, at its core, an economy-based scaling Joker. Therefore, having more money makes it better, as one can afford more expensive Jokers to scale it. There are many options, but it's recommended to go for more powerful ones, like Cloud 9 or Golden Ticket, as Joker slots are limited with Dagger. Riff-Raff can supply joker cards to scale the Dagger. This alleviates the economic strain before one can obtain strong sources of money. Joker Stencil will provide increased X Mult when Ceremonial Dagger consumes one Joker at the start of each blind, since an empty slot is created. Strong sources of X Mult are very much appreciated, as they push Dagger's Mult even higher and allow one to win faster, therefore getting more money. Note that if Ceremonial Dagger is to the left of a different joker which triggers \"When Blind is selected\" (such as Cartomancer, Riff-Raff or Burglar), the Ceremonial Dagger will destroy the other joker before it can trigger.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes.

This Joker cannot receive the Perishable sticker. Because players need to buy a lot of Jokers to scale Ceremonial Dagger, the Yellow Deck is a good option as the early bonus money allows players to get to $25 quickly and be able to save up a lot for the Dagger. Black Deck's extra Joker slot is very helpful, as one can still have five Jokers while scaling Dagger. Inversely, Painted Deck's reduced Joker amount is very bad to combo with Dagger, as you will only have three Jokers while scaling Dagger. The Anaglyph Deck is occasionally a good choice as the Double Tag can provide lots of economic buff when presented, however skipping a blind means skipping a level of scaling. This Joker can sometimes make it more difficult to change your deck due to needing a constant supply of money to fuel its destruction of other Jokers. As a result, it might be best to prioritize easier-to-play hands. However, the hand you play doesn't really matter, as the Mult Dagger provides will always apply. Jokers that can add sell value to cards can increase dagger's effect, such as Gift Card, which increases all of your jokers' sell value by $1 per round; and Egg, which gains $3 of sell value per round. Swashbuckler, which also benefits from higher sell values, can act as a sort of mini-Dagger until you find it. Ceremonial Dagger is, at its core, an economy-based scaling Joker. Therefore, having more money makes it better, as one can afford more expensive Jokers to scale it. There are many options, but it's recommended to go for more powerful ones, like Cloud 9 or Golden Ticket, as Joker slots are limited with Dagger. Riff-Raff can supply joker cards to scale the Dagger. This alleviates the economic strain before one can obtain strong sources of money. Joker Stencil will provide increased X Mult when Ceremonial Dagger consumes one Joker at the start of each blind, since an empty slot is created. Strong sources of X Mult are very much appreciated, as they push Dagger's Mult even higher and allow one to win faster, therefore getting more money. Note that if Ceremonial Dagger is to the left of a different joker which triggers \"When Blind is selected\" (such as Cartomancer, Riff-Raff or Burglar), the Ceremonial Dagger will destroy the other joker before it can trigger. The Clearance Sale and Liquidation Vouchers are very bad to combo with Dagger. Their reduced prices also affects sell value, and sell value rounds down, making Dagger much less effective. It is impossible to get more than +4 per Joker after Liquidation except from a few Editioned Rare Jokers, Legendaries, or from scaling sell value effects such as Egg and Gift Card. The Reroll Surplus, Reroll Glut, Overstock, and Overstock Plus Vouchers all make it easier to look for more expensive Jokers to scale Dagger."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Death","title":"Tarot Cards","content":"Tarot Cards are a form of consumable you can obtain during a run.

No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an \"initial\" Voucher can the player then claim the \"dependent\" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock. If the shop runs out of Vouchers, either due to excessive spawning from the Voucher skip Tag, or because all 32 Vouchers have been bought, only Blank Vouchers can show up.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker.

Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker. There are eight Stake Stickers, which are listed here in the same order as their respective Stakes."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ethereal","title":"Tags","content":"Tags are benefits you receive for skipping a Small Blind or Big Blind. Depending on the type of tag, it may trigger immediately or it may not trigger until a certain gamestate or condition is met (for example, the next time you visit the Shop). There are 24 Tags available, and you can hold multiple at once until they're used. The chance for each Tag to appear is the same. The same Tag can appear multiple times during a run and even during the same Ante. However, during Ante 1, the Negative, Standard, Meteor, Buffoon, Handy, Garbage, Ethereal, Top-up, and Orbital cannot be encountered. Five tags also have a hidden unlock requirement: for the Rare tag you need to have discovered Blueprint (which means winning 1 run), and for the Negative, Foil, Holographic and Polychrome Tags you need to have discovered their respective editions. The Joker is extra generated, and guaranteed to appear in next shop, which is not affected by Vouchers that relatively lower the weight of Jokers in Shop (see The Shop#Vouchers), or certain Challenges that Jokers' spawn rate is set to 0. Can be stacked with Edition Tags, generating a free Joker with Editions. If there are no base edition Jokers in the next shop, these tags will instead be stored. Works with Uncommon and Rare Tag if the generated Joker doesn't have an Edition naturally. Can be stacked on one shop until there are no base edition Jokers. Can be stacked on one Boss Blind, each adding additional $25 bonus. Can be stacked on one shop until all available vouchers appear (excluding bought vouchers and upgrades of unbought vouchers). Added vouchers do not carry over to later shops in the ante. Other effects of opening Booster Packs (like Red Card and Hallucination) can be activated as normal. Other effects of opening Booster Packs (like Red Card and Hallucination) can be activated as normal. Other parts of the shop (such as Vouchers and Items generated after rerolls) keep their usual costs. Can be stacked on one Tag earned, each adding one additional copy of (instead of doubling) that Tag. Can be stacked multiple times on the same round, each adding an additional +3 Hand size. The price will go up $1 per Reroll as normal. The Jokers created cannot have Stickers, like Eternal/Perishable/Rental, even at higher stakes. Guaranteed to give at least $5, as it includes the Blind skipped to gain this tag. The hand can be a secret hand if it has already been played in this run. If your balance is negative your money is not doubled, instead giving you $0 and essentially wasting the tag.

With many other similar cards having an activation requirement or warranting scaling, this Mult bonus makes Cavendish among the best in its class, arguably the best Common Joker, and potentially one of the best in the game. Obtaining this potassium bomb is not particularly straightforward, however: in order for Cavendish to appear anywhere, Gros Michel needs to destroy itself through its own effect first during the same run. It also comes with a minuscule, but potentially devastating risk inherited from its more fragile ancestor, in the form of a 1 in 1000 chance to destroy itself at the end of the round, which can deprive the player of most of their scoring power. While it can potentially be rediscovered more easily, this is hard to guarantee unless the player has a huge amount of money they can justify cutting into. This Joker works well with any of the Decks, as it gives a strong X3 Mult to every hand played. Since the chance of Cavendish destroying itself is only 0.1%, one can safely ignore this possibility with 99.9% confidence. Any hand can benefit from this Joker for the same reasons that any of the Decks can, although a stronger hand with a higher base Mult will generally work better. One should focus on their most Levelled poker hands, if possible, and/or their most played hand while also using Supernova."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Eye","title":"Blinds and Antes","content":"Blinds are the main obstacle that the player must overcome in Balatro. For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes.

Without one, your run will likely die by the Ante 2 Boss Blind, if not sooner. Some good Chips / Mult jokers for this section of the game are: Once you get past the early game, it's time to pivot your build into one or two specific hands type, and pick up Jokers that improve your odds accordingly. Always have at least one +Chip Joker, one +Mult Joker (preferably scaling type, be it Fortune Teller, Spare Trousers, Ride the Bus, etc... A major factor in winning a run is forming a build. A build is a combination of Jokers and enhanced cards of specific ranks or suits which synergize well together. A good example of a build would be this: This build utilizes Baron's and Mime's abilities together to cause every King held in hand to grant approximately X5 Mult. As every card held in hand has a 100% chance of being a Steel King, plus Juggler and Troubadour increasing the hand size to 11, and steel cards are affected by Mime's ability, this leads to an incredibly high amount of multiplier, that is very likely to beat any blind thrown it's way. Every other Joker in this build has an effect that directly supports Baron's ability. Jokers working together like this is called a synergy, and taking advantage of these synergies is key to victory. And while yes, it is possible to win with Jokers that don't synergize, you are much more likely to win with Jokers that do."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Gift_Card","title":"Gift Card","content":"This Joker doesn't synergise with any Poker Hand."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Gift_Card_(Joker)","title":"Gift Card","content":"This Joker doesn't synergise with any Poker Hand."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Glass_Card","title":"Card Modifiers","content":"Modifiers are upgrades that can be applied to cards that provide many different benefits, such as improved scoring capability, money generation, or card manipulation.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker.

When a hand is played, effects will activate in the following orders. (Some Jokers may have different parts trigger at different stages: for example, Wee Joker gain chips 'on scored' and adds chips to total 'independently'). See Activation Type for a full list of when different Jokers activate. Almost all card arrangement problems stem from the order of additive Mult and multiplicative Mult. According to the law of distribution, the +Mult activating before the xMult gives a higher score. For example, a hand normally scoring 40 x 4 is played and a +4 Mult Joker and a X2 Mult Ramen is present. If the Joker is on the left of Ramen, the hand will score 40 x ((4+4)x2) = 640 chips whereas the reversed placement will only score 40 x ((4x2)+4) = 480 chips. This concept applies to the order of cards played and in hand as well as Jokers. For a higher score, the player may arrange in the following ways: In case the player wanted a lower score for purposes like scaling Jokers, they may put +Mult to the right of xMult.

Always have at least one +Chip Joker, one +Mult Joker (preferably scaling type, be it Fortune Teller, Spare Trousers, Ride the Bus, etc... A major factor in winning a run is forming a build. A build is a combination of Jokers and enhanced cards of specific ranks or suits which synergize well together. A good example of a build would be this: This build utilizes Baron's and Mime's abilities together to cause every King held in hand to grant approximately X5 Mult. As every card held in hand has a 100% chance of being a Steel King, plus Juggler and Troubadour increasing the hand size to 11, and steel cards are affected by Mime's ability, this leads to an incredibly high amount of multiplier, that is very likely to beat any blind thrown it's way. Every other Joker in this build has an effect that directly supports Baron's ability. Jokers working together like this is called a synergy, and taking advantage of these synergies is key to victory.

Whenever the number of cards held in hand falls below Hand Size after playing a Hand or Discard, cards will be drawn into your hand from your Deck until the number of cards in hand matches your Hand Size. The only exceptions are when the number of cards remaining in your Deck is insufficient, in which case you will simply draw all the remaining cards in your Deck, or when facing The Serpent Boss Blind, where exactly 3 cards are drawn after every played Hand or Discard, ignoring Hand Size. A smaller Hand Size can be beneficial with e.g. Blackboard, since its effect is triggered when there are no (non-wild) Diamonds, Hearts, or Stone Cards left in hand after playing a Hand, which is easier to achieve with a smaller Hand Size. However, in all other situations, a larger Hand Size is more beneficial since it allows more options and flexibility when playing hands or discarding and allows for the possibility of triggering more card held in hand abilities. Furthermore, it allows more options when opening Spectral and Arcana Packs by providing more card options to apply the effects to, and in the case of Sigil and Ouija, where the effects apply to every card in hand, having a larger Hand Size increase the impact of those cards. Hand size can be increased or decreased by Vouchers, Jokers, Spectral Cards, or Boss Blinds. Painted Deck starts with +2 Hand Size, increasing the starting Hand Size to 10. The Paint Brush and Palette Vouchers each add +1 Hand Size. Some Jokers increase hand size: Some Jokers decrease the player's hand size: The Spectral Cards Ectoplasm[1] and Ouija reduce Hand Size by -1. The Boss Blind The Manacle temporarily reduces Hand Size by -1. It is possible to hold more cards than your Hand Size in certain situations. This can happen when cards are added to your hand outside of normal drawing. This can be done using Familiar, Grim, Incantation, or Cryptid. Some Jokers also force cards into your hand: DNA[2] or Certificate. The boss blind The Serpent can also let you hold more/less cards than your hand size."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Hands","title":"Poker Hands","content":"An overview of poker hands across the game. The list of poker hands can be accessed by pressing \"Run Info\".Poker Hands are sets of between one and five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are usually upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

The Vouchers are split into 16 pairs, each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. Within each pair is a weaker \"initial\" Voucher (costs $10) and a stronger \"dependent\" Voucher (costs an additional $10) that generally enhances the effect of the former. No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an \"initial\" Voucher can the player then claim the \"dependent\" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock.

Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number).

With all that said, a quick glance at the Blind requirements past Ante 1 makes it incredibly clear that Joker does not scale well to the later Antes at all; Abstract Joker, for example, is a direct upgrade to it while holding more than 1 Joker card, and several other cards like Green Joker, Ride the Bus, and Supernova can put out power equivalent to dozens of this Joker with their Additive Mult scaling capabilities. As a result, it should generally be sold once the player has the rest of their Joker slots filled with more impactful Jokers, or perhaps even earlier if gaining its sell value means earning more interest next round.

With all that said, a quick glance at the Blind requirements past Ante 1 makes it incredibly clear that Joker does not scale well to the later Antes at all; Abstract Joker, for example, is a direct upgrade to it while holding more than 1 Joker card, and several other cards like Green Joker, Ride the Bus, and Supernova can put out power equivalent to dozens of this Joker with their Additive Mult scaling capabilities. As a result, it should generally be sold once the player has the rest of their Joker slots filled with more impactful Jokers, or perhaps even earlier if gaining its sell value means earning more interest next round. It can potentially be kept many Antes later if it has an Edition, or even permanently if it ends up being Negative, but even then, its help as a baseline is exactly the same as a single Mult Card provided by The Empress Tarot Card, so its impact will be at best marginal."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Joker_Stencil","title":"Joker Stencil","content":"Strong, five-cards hand like Flush, Straight or Full House synergizes well with Joker Stencil thanks to their high base Mult.

Instead of being included in Decks and played alongside standard cards, Jokers are obtained through the Shop and occasionally other means, and are held in the player's dedicated Joker slots until the player sells them or they are destroyed. Players usually start with five Joker slots, but can lose or gain slots in some circumstances. Jokers possess unique effects that can synergize, and a strong combination of Jokers is typically essential for the player to defeat Blinds at higher Antes. As of update 1.0.1o-FULL, there are 150 total Jokers of varying rarities, with 105 unlocked from the start and 45 unlockable through specific conditions. Various editions displayed in the Collection.Jokers can be enhanced with one of four different Editions, resulting in higher shop costs but adding an additional effect: In higher stakes, Jokers can also appear with Eternal, Perishable, and/or Rental Stickers. Jokers have four different rarities, denoting how likely they are to appear in a given run: Common (61 Jokers), Uncommon (64 Jokers), Rare (20 Jokers), and Legendary (5 Jokers). In general, higher rarity Jokers can be more powerful, but when a Joker has no direct analogue of a lower rarity, it can be difficult to determine if it is \"better\". When generating Jokers at random, there is a 70% chance of generating a Common Joker, a 25% chance of generating an Uncommon Joker, and a 5% chance of generating a Rare Joker. A Legendary Joker can only appear from The Soul Spectral Card. Jokers have a number of key terms that are vital in understanding how they work. (also see Activation type and Activation sequence for additional information) Available Jokers show as Not Discovered in the player's Collection until they are obtained in the course of an unseeded run. Most locked Jokers in the Collection show the unlock condition, and in some cases will show how close the player is to fulfilling that condition. There are also five secret Legendary Jokers that cannot be bought in the store, and get unlocked when obtained through the Soul spectral card. More information on each Joker such as the detail of their interactions and exceptions can be found on that Joker's respective page. The Balatro Wiki sorts Jokers into seven types. In the table below, the Joker type is shown using the following symbols:"},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Jolly_Joker","title":"Jolly Joker","content":"The rationale for using this Joker is mostly comparable to that of the standard Joker, with its effect being stronger at the cost of a mild condition and a higher buy price.

Unless better options are encountered, it should be sold the moment a better Joker contends for its spot. Virtually all of the Decks work comparably well with Jolly Joker, as Pair is the easiest hand to assemble - barring High Card (which always is assembled), and it is all but guaranteed to find one after a discard or two outside of the most extreme circumstances. Jolly Joker can trigger on any hand except for High Card. Through deck manipulation, even Flushes can benefit. Straight Flushes can benefit under very specific cases when combined with Four Fingers; Straight can benefit under similar circumstances if these two Jokers are also combined with Splash, although this is a highly impractical combo and should be avoided."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Jolly_Joker_(Joker)","title":"Jolly Joker","content":"The rationale for using this Joker is mostly comparable to that of the standard Joker, with its effect being stronger at the cost of a mild condition and a higher buy price.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes.

The Vouchers are split into 16 pairs, each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. Within each pair is a weaker \"initial\" Voucher (costs $10) and a stronger \"dependent\" Voucher (costs an additional $10) that generally enhances the effect of the former. No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an \"initial\" Voucher can the player then claim the \"dependent\" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock.

It also appears as the target score in Ante 39 as \"nan,\" since 4.8e309 overflows to Naneinf. For this reason it is not possible to progress past this Ante. 'nan' means Not a Number, 'e' is the scientific notation for the exponent, specifically where the game is multiplying a number by 10 raised to a power, and 'inf' is an abbreviation for Infinity. Naneinf score displayBalatro uses the IEEE-754 double-precision floating point format which has a finite amount of space to store uncountably infinite values. In practice any value over ~1.80e308 is just called “Infinity”. 1.80e308 ≈ 2^1024(1 − 2^-53) which is the largest representable 64-bit floating point number. The game code has to figure out how to display extremely high numbers in the score counter. First it checks if the number is less than 1e11. Since “Infinity” is indeed greater than 1e11, it must be displayed in scientific notation. Then the game checks what the base 10 logarithm of the number is, rounded down - this is the number after the exponent “e”. For 5.4e12, this is 12. For 1e24 it is 24. IEEE-754 says that log10(Infinity) = Infinity, which rounds down to Infinity, or 'inf' for short. The final step is to get the mantissa, which is obtained by dividing the original score by 10 to the power of the rounded down exponent: 5.4e12/(10^12) is 5.4, and Infinity/(10^Infinity) = Infinity/Infinity which is illogical. IEEE-754 says this is an invalid operation, and declares that the result is Not A Number: 'NaN'. The game turns these outputs into text strings — “nan” and “inf” — and displays them with the scientific notation “e” (the exponent, meaning times 10 to the power of) in the middle to get “naneinf” in the score counter. All mathematical comparisons are considered false when comparing to nan. This is why Mr. Bones does not prevent death on Ante 39: the player's score is compared to 25% of nan, which is nan, and therefore it is determined the player did not score enough to be saved by Mr. Bones. Achieving naneinf is usually done by using a Baron and Mime setup.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker.

The same Tag can appear multiple times during a run and even during the same Ante. However, during Ante 1, the Negative, Standard, Meteor, Buffoon, Handy, Garbage, Ethereal, Top-up, and Orbital cannot be encountered. Five tags also have a hidden unlock requirement: for the Rare tag you need to have discovered Blueprint (which means winning 1 run), and for the Negative, Foil, Holographic and Polychrome Tags you need to have discovered their respective editions.

Painted Deck's extra hand size makes Straights easier to find. All decks work with The Order to some degree, except for certain Erratic Deck configurations which have gaps that make it impossible to have a straight. The Order will trigger on Straights and Straight Flushes. As all Straight hands have high Chip scaling from Planet cards, The Order can lend itself well to high-level Straight or Straight Flush runs. Four Fingers and Shortcut both allow Straights to be made more easily. Having either of these will make Straight builds much more reliable, making The Order easier to trigger. Jokers that give bonuses when Straights are played, like Crazy Joker and Devious Joker, work well with The Order. Runner is the primary example of this, as it gives scaling Chips when you play the hand you already want to play if you have The Order. Sources of scaling +Mult are useful, as they allow The Order to multiply a larger amount of Mult. Particularly, Supernova is great, as playing Straights, your primary scoring hand if you have The Order, scales its Mult. You may need to place it after The Order on easier rounds to scale it more, however, if you are winning in one hand. Séance, if it can be properly utilized, can be a source of Spectral cards that can help Straight builds, like Aura, Incantation/Familiar & Grim (depending on which Straights one is playing more often), and Immolate to destroy certain ranks not used in your Straights. In the same vein, Superposition gives mild synergy by giving a Tarot card from high and low Ace Straights, but this isn't very strong compared to the benefits of many other Jokers. Deck thinning is more useful to Straight builds than others, as adding cards doesn't necessarily make Straights more likely. For this reason, Trading Card and Erosion can form a strong combo with The Order, as you destroy all cards that aren't in your chosen Straight, making them more likely, and provide scaling Mult for The Order to work off of. Other XMult Jokers are useful, as they will multiply the Mult The Order creates. This is true in general for Straight builds, as their Chip scaling is much higher than their Mult scaling. A good scaling XMult Joker, or multiple non-scaling ones, can make these builds have more evenly distributed the Chips and Mult than others, producing higher scores."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ouija","title":"Spectral Cards","content":"Spectral Cards are a form of consumable you can obtain during a run. Spectral Cards are similar to Tarot Cards in the sense that they generally modify the playing cards in the deck as well, though to a much greater extent than Tarot Cards.

There are 18 different cards with no unlock conditions, but they can usually only be found in booster packs and not individually (unless with Ghost Deck).

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

These come in five categories: These are refreshed or restocked at the next shop. Purchasing a booster pack opens it immediately, where it then reveals multiple card options for the player to choose. For Tarot and Spectral packs, a hand of playing cards is also dealt from the player's deck to apply the effects on. Usually only one consumable option can be used, and the rest disappear after the player has used that card. If none of the options are appealing or suitable, the player can also choose to skip without using any card, and they are all discarded as well. Each category of booster comes in three sizes - normal, jumbo and mega - with each providing more choice than the previous one. Within each size, there can be variety in the artwork, but the behavior of these packs stays the same. When drawing Booster Packs for the shop, not all boosters are equally likely.

Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers.

Has Anti-Synergy with Black Deck due to the -1 hand penalty. Spare Trousers's additive Mult increases by +2 any time the player plays a Poker Hand that contains a Two Pair. A Two Pair, a Full House, or a Flush House will always trigger this increase, even if any of the cards are debuffed by a Boss Blind. A Flush may also trigger this increase if it is assembled in such a way that it also contains a Two Pair; for example, a valid Flush for Spare Trousers would be K K J 9 9 with a matching suit. Four of a Kind, Five of a Kind, and Flush Five do not trigger Spare Trousers' increase. Spare Trousers's usefulness is comparable to a bell curve over time. Initially, Spare Trousers has no bonus, and the player needs to play a Two Pair hand for it to have any benefit at all. Since any played hand can only ever include one Two Pair at a time, it can potentially take numerous hands and rounds of a run to build up Spare Trousers to a point where it feels strong. In other words, Spare Trousers requires a significant time investment, plus a conscious effort to play as many Two Pair hands as possible. Furthermore, since it can only be increased by +2 Mult per hand at most, in the late game (beginning around Ante level 7 and higher) the player runs the risk of being unable to increase Spare Trousers quickly enough to keep it viable. Usually, the player can raise Spare Trousers to around +40 Mult by the time they reach Ante level 8, but if Spare Trousers was the centerpiece of their build, they may struggle against the Finisher Blind and any subsequent Boss Blinds.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers).

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

Creates a Tarot card when discarded (Must have room) Can be from discards by the player, or from the automatic discard of The Hook boss blind. See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers.

The same Tag can appear multiple times during a run and even during the same Ante. However, during Ante 1, the Negative, Standard, Meteor, Buffoon, Handy, Garbage, Ethereal, Top-up, and Orbital cannot be encountered. Five tags also have a hidden unlock requirement: for the Rare tag you need to have discovered Blueprint (which means winning 1 run), and for the Negative, Foil, Holographic and Polychrome Tags you need to have discovered their respective editions.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers.

Progression through the different stakes is unique to each starting deck, meaning that you must unlock each stake individually for each deck. The 8 stakes, listed in the order that they are unlocked. Note that each stake applies the modifiers of all previous stakes.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers. A Deck similarly will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Deck. The game also keeps track of how many Stake Stickers you have earned for Jokers and Decks. This is found in the Profile menu, under Progress. For Jokers there are 1200 (150 Jokers * 8 Stickers) in total, and for Decks there are 120 (15 Decks * 8 Stickers). Some Achievements make use of these Stickers, such as Completionist++, which requires you to earn a Gold Sticker on every Joker. There are eight Stake Stickers, which are listed here in the same order as their respective Stakes."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Raised_Fist","title":"Raised Fist","content":"As Raised Fist is at most +22 Mult, it is usually only useful during the early game, and will generally be replaced with better jokers as play progresses. However, Raised Fist can achieve surprisingly high scores into the later game if the rest of your hand is filled with Steel cards. Raised Fist triggers on the lowest value card, not on its position in the Jokers. In other words, Raised Fist can be considered an \"in hand\" effect, like Baron, Shoot the Moon, or Steel cards. As such, if you have any x Mult cards in your hand when using Raised Fist, make sure to move the lowest ranked card to the left to benefit from the multipliers. Raised Fist gives +0 Mult on debuffed cards. It also gives +0 Mult for Stone cards (although it will normally ignore these and will pick a different low rank card instead). Raised Fist always acts on the rightmost card of the lowest rank. If you have two or more cards of the lowest rank, and one is debuffed or one has a red seal, make sure to put the better card on right. If your smallest ranked card is a Steel card, the 1.5x Mult will always trigger before the Raised Fist (which, unfortunately, is a bad thing for the player). Deck manipulation through Tarot Cards can help increase the likelihood of gaining more value from Raised Fist. The following cards are of note: Painted Deck is usually bad with Raised Fist, as more hand size makes it harder to remove all the low-ranked cards from hand. It can benefit from Raised Fist if its low-rank cards are removed, as this deck specializes in In Hand effects. This would likely not be something to build around, though, as Painted Deck's fewer Joker slots makes spending one unnecessarily on Raised Fist questionable. Ghost Deck's access to hand-reducing Spectral cards, a bit counter-intuitively, makes Raised Fist better, as it can more reliably trigger on higher rank cards. If there's only one card in hand, it will always use it, after all. Poker hands that contain less than 5 cards, such as pair and high card, work best because you can play cards for chips, and also play low cards that won't be held in hand when played. Flushes can also work with Raised Fist if you play the lowest ranked cards of the same suit; as rank is not a specific requirement for a Flush, it offers flexibility to choose ranks that the other five card hands do not have. Raised Fist is best on In Hand strategies, mainly in regards to Baron, though it helps Shoot the Moon if one is using Steel Queens. By having a non-King in hand and positioning every King after it, the X1.5 Mult from Baron can work on a larger base. If one has many retrigger abilities or a high Hand Mult, to the point where another In Hand King provides greater value, it should be replaced, but that is uncommon except on certain seeds or in endless mode. It can be invaluable for helping more fragile Baron builds get off the ground. Mime Will retrigger raised fist since its effect triggers on cards in hand. Stuntman: The reduced hand size makes it easier to play all the smaller ranked cards from your hand. an early Stuntman + Raised Fist can score over 5,000 for each high card played, making it arguably the most efficient money-to-score ratio that two jokers have together. Hack can provide limited synergy, since it benefits from the play of low value cards. However, by using Hack, the chances low-rank cards will be left in hand is also higher, as one will usually want to centralize around them."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Raised_Fist_(Joker)","title":"Raised Fist","content":"As Raised Fist is at most +22 Mult, it is usually only useful during the early game, and will generally be replaced with better jokers as play progresses.

When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers.

To unlock a stake for a deck, you must complete a run using the highest currently unlocked stake. Progression through the different stakes is unique to each starting deck, meaning that you must unlock each stake individually for each deck. The 8 stakes, listed in the order that they are unlocked. Note that each stake applies the modifiers of all previous stakes.

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped.

The list of poker hands can be accessed by pressing \"Run Info\".Poker Hands are sets of between one and five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are usually upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers. These Poker Hands will not appear in the Run Info screen until you've played them at least once, after which they will show up on the info menu, and their respective Planet Cards will be obtainable only during the current run.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

Creates a Tarot card when discarded (Must have room) Can be from discards by the player, or from the automatic discard of The Hook boss blind. See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers.

This also includes Royal Flushes. Séance cannot provide The Soul or Black Hole, as both can only be found in Booster Packs. Séance is a bit of an odd Joker, as very few Spectral cards benefit from full Straight Flush builds. It is best used as a temporary Spectral generator that does not have limited uses, like Sixth Sense does, to create useful Spectrals that can then facilitate other builds. Anything that benefits from certain Spectral cards, theoretically, has some synergy with Séance. For this reason, the synergies listed are split into two sections: ways to make more Straight Flushes, to maximize the Spectral cards Séance can give; and ways to use those Spectral cards to their maximum effect. Straight Flushes (and Royal Flushes) are the only hands relevant to this Joker."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Seed_Money","title":"Vouchers","content":"Vouchers are items offered in the shop, and refresh or restock in the shop after the players first completed round, after defeating the boss blind of each ante, or by claiming the Voucher Tag and skipping a blind. Unlike consumable items, Vouchers and their effects are permanent and remain effective for the entirety of a run. There are 32 Vouchers in total. The Vouchers are split into 16 pairs, each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. Within each pair is a weaker \"initial\" Voucher (costs $10) and a stronger \"dependent\" Voucher (costs an additional $10) that generally enhances the effect of the former. No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an \"initial\" Voucher can the player then claim the \"dependent\" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock. If the shop runs out of Vouchers, either due to excessive spawning from the Voucher skip Tag, or because all 32 Vouchers have been bought, only Blank Vouchers can show up.

Red Deck is able to find better hands on average, so Seltzer will last longer, as less hands need to be played per round. Black Deck is able to stack more Jokers that benefit from Seltzer's effect. Adding even a single X Mult Joker like Ancient Joker can be an extra X7.5 Mult normally, but with Seltzer it becomes an extra X57.

Throwback can allow you to skip blinds more often, making Seltzer usable more times in the more difficult Boss Blinds.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

The Shop is only accessible after defeating a Small Blind, Big Bind, or Boss Blind. By default, the shop sells: The random cards sold are drawn with the default weights: This can be rewritten to the approximate chances of each card: With the Magic Trick Voucher, playing cards are given a weight of 4; the Illusion Voucher makes playing cards enhanced 40% of the time, editioned 20% of the time, and is unaffected by Hone/Glow Up. The Tarot Merchant Voucher raises the Tarot Card weight to 9.6 while the Tarot Tycoon Voucher raises the weight to 32. The Planet Merchant and Planet Tycoon Vouchers work in the same way. With the Ghost Deck, Spectral Cards can appear with a weight of 2. The number of available random cards can be increased by the Overstock and Overstock Plus vouchers, which increases the number of sold cards to 3 and 4 respectively. You may pay money to reroll the shop an unlimited number of times, removing any of the remaining random cards and replacing them with 2 new random cards. The reroll cost starts at $5 and increases $1 each time you reroll, resetting to $5 upon entering a new shop. However, rerolling the shop does not restock Booster Packs or the Voucher. Booster packs only restock upon entering a new shop, and the Voucher restocks after defeating the boss blind. All items have a buy cost (purchase price) and a sell cost (selling value), which are recalculated every time the player interacts with the item. These follow consistent formulas for calculating them, with some exceptions applied due to other in-game items. The total buy cost of an item normally consists of its base cost, an edition cost (if it has an Edition), applying discounts (if certain Vouchers are purchased), and rounding any fractions half down. The minimum buy cost of an item is usually $1, with some special exceptions. The total sell cost of an item consists of the total buy cost halved, and rounded down. The minimum sell cost of an item is always $1.All items have a base cost, even Legendary Jokers (which can't be found in the shop). Playing Cards can only be found in the Shop after purchasing the Magic Trick Voucher, and Spectral Cards can only be found when playing with the Ghost Deck. Jokers and Playing Cards (with Illusion) can have Editions, which raises their price in the shop and their sell value. Consumables can have a Negative Edition when generated by Perkeo, which raises their sell value, but they can never be found in the shop with an edition. After purchasing the Clearance Sale and Liquidation Vouchers, a 25% or 50% discount is applied to the buy cost of all items in the shop. This also indirectly affects the sell cost of all items. After multiplying by this number, the result is then rounded half down (for example, 8.5 is rounded to 8). This cannot result in a price of $0 or lower, and the buy cost will always be a minimum of $1 after the Discount step. The total buy cost is recalculated from scratch (applying any vouchers bought in-between, any special case that changes the buy cost, etc), divided by 2, and floored (rounded down). This also cannot result in a sell price of $0 or lower, and it will always be a minimum of $1."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Shortcut","title":"Shortcut","content":""},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Shortcut_(Joker)","title":"Shortcut","content":""},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Showman","title":"Showman","content":"Any deck can benefit from Showman, but the Black Deck allows it to shine thanks to the +1 Joker Slot bonus.

Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop.

See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers.

A standard deck consists of 4 suits, with 13 cards of different rank in each suite. The suits are found in the following order: the Spade suit, the Heart suit, the Club suit, and the Diamond suit, shown from top to bottom in the visual deck display, and left to right in your hand when sorting by suit (while the rank acts as the tiebreaker). This is true even when the cards are drawn face down, allowing you to guess at a card's suit. Each suit contains an Ace followed by King, Queen, and Jack, and then 10-2, shown left to right both in the visual deck display and in your hand when sorted by suit. When your hand is sorted by rank, the ranks are ordered from left to right, (A, KQJ, 10-2) while the suits act as the tiebreaker. This is true even when the cards are face down, allowing you to guess at a card's rank. (For example, in rank sort, an Ace of Diamonds will be sorted to the right of an Ace of Spades, but to the left of a King of any suit.) Some decks in Balatro (such as the Checkered Deck or the Erratic Deck) use a different distribution of cards, and some consumables and Jokers can manipulate the suits in a deck. Wild Cards are considered to be every suit simultaneously, meaning they can benefit from multiple suit-related Jokers (and be penalized by any suit-related Boss Blind). However, for Jokers such as Flower Pot and Seeing Double, each Wild Card will only count as one suit at a time. The Spade suit is one of four suits in Balatro. It is one of two black suits, the other being the Club suit. The Spade suit is colored dark blue-black.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once.

Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes.

The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind.

Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected.

Painted Deck's extra hand size makes Straights easier to find. All decks work with The Order to some degree, except for certain Erratic Deck configurations which have gaps that make it impossible to have a straight. The Order will trigger on Straights and Straight Flushes. As all Straight hands have high Chip scaling from Planet cards, The Order can lend itself well to high-level Straight or Straight Flush runs. Four Fingers and Shortcut both allow Straights to be made more easily. Having either of these will make Straight builds much more reliable, making The Order easier to trigger. Jokers that give bonuses when Straights are played, like Crazy Joker and Devious Joker, work well with The Order. Runner is the primary example of this, as it gives scaling Chips when you play the hand you already want to play if you have The Order. Sources of scaling +Mult are useful, as they allow The Order to multiply a larger amount of Mult. Particularly, Supernova is great, as playing Straights, your primary scoring hand if you have The Order, scales its Mult.

Deck thinning is more useful to Straight builds than others, as adding cards doesn't necessarily make Straights more likely. For this reason, Trading Card and Erosion can form a strong combo with The Order, as you destroy all cards that aren't in your chosen Straight, making them more likely, and provide scaling Mult for The Order to work off of. Other XMult Jokers are useful, as they will multiply the Mult The Order creates. This is true in general for Straight builds, as their Chip scaling is much higher than their Mult scaling.

Painted Deck's extra hand size makes Straights easier to find. All decks work with The Order to some degree, except for certain Erratic Deck configurations which have gaps that make it impossible to have a straight. The Order will trigger on Straights and Straight Flushes. As all Straight hands have high Chip scaling from Planet cards, The Order can lend itself well to high-level Straight or Straight Flush runs. Four Fingers and Shortcut both allow Straights to be made more easily. Having either of these will make Straight builds much more reliable, making The Order easier to trigger. Jokers that give bonuses when Straights are played, like Crazy Joker and Devious Joker, work well with The Order. Runner is the primary example of this, as it gives scaling Chips when you play the hand you already want to play if you have The Order. Sources of scaling +Mult are useful, as they allow The Order to multiply a larger amount of Mult. Particularly, Supernova is great, as playing Straights, your primary scoring hand if you have The Order, scales its Mult.

The list of poker hands can be accessed by pressing \"Run Info\".Poker Hands are sets of between one and five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are usually upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers. These Poker Hands will not appear in the Run Info screen until you've played them at least once, after which they will show up on the info menu, and their respective Planet Cards will be obtainable only during the current run. These Poker Hands will also be upgraded by Black Hole, even before they are unlocked.

It also works well with decks that do not necessarily gain much from going to shops or from playing Blinds, like Black Deck (that already plays fewer hands per Blind, meaning you get less money or Joker effects from it). Jokers that have powerful up-front effects generally work great with Throwback, as they allow you to skip blinds and boost Throwback without compromising the other Jokers' scaling. Flat XMult jokers, like Driver's License, Cavendish, Seeing Double, etc., provide an exponential effect for Throwback. Flat + Mult jokers, like Half Joker, Mystic Summit, Jolly Joker, etc., can provide a larger base mult for Throwback, though depending on your build's hand type, per-card mult boosts may be stronger. Since Throwback can boost mult to insane values, it can be worth investing in a + Chips joker, like Stuntman or Bull, to improve that side of the equation. Since Throwback prioritizes skipping blinds, consumable Jokers ( Popcorn, Ice Cream, Seltzer, and similar) go through fewer hands, allowing them to be useful for more Antes. Diet Cola empowers the skips you do, allowing you to double the bonus from a strong tag. Glass cards work very well with Throwback, as you can gain X2 Mult, and the risk to losing the cards is reduced because you are playing fewer hands. Throwback inherently does better on higher Stakes, as multiple of them lessen the reward from fighting Blinds or from the Shop, making skips more enticing. However, it can occasionally struggle from the faster Ante scaling from Green and Purple Stake. Because Throwback needs to skip Blinds to scale, it is very bad with Jokers that require action taken in Blinds or the shop to scale. For example, Hologram, Vampire, Supernova, Loyalty Card, etc. It can be decent if a couple of blinds were skipped in the past as a temporary midgame choice, but there are often better alternatives for builds that use these kinds of scaling."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Throwback_(Joker)","title":"Throwback","content":"Anaglyph Deck is by far the best deck to use Throwback with, as the Double Tags it generates make skipping Blinds much more appealing.

After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

The list of poker hands can be accessed by pressing \"Run Info\".Poker Hands are sets of between one and five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are usually upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the Black Hole Spectral card, Burnt Joker, and Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by The Arm. Higher tier hands take precedence over lower tier hands regardless of their level or scoring, for example, if your hand is K K K K 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are unscored. For example, if an Ace is played high with 4 other cards, only the High card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded fancily and have no effect. The two main exceptions to this rule are Stone Cards, which always score, and Splash, which allows all played cards to score. There are three \"secret\" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding cards to your deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers. These Poker Hands will not appear in the Run Info screen until you've played them at least once, after which they will show up on the info menu, and their respective Planet Cards will be obtainable only during the current run.

Vampire removes Enhancements before their effect occurs, meaning the Enhancements cannot activate. All scored cards will get their Enhancements removed. Vampire also cannot change the type of Poker Hand retroactively, for example removing Wild would still keep the Poker Hand as Flush. There are a few notable interactions: Due to the need of constantly finding enhanced cards to feed the Vampire, the Zodiac Deck, Magic Deck or the Black Deck will work well for the vampire. Additionally, the Ghost Deck also provides good utility to find Enhancements for the Vampire to feed upon. Spectral cards such as Incantation, Grim or Familiar will provide a net positive in enhanced cards even though the deck will become larger as a result. Cards such as Aura also provide utility in that the edition of a card does not get eaten by the vampire: a Holographic card stays holographic after the hand is played, hence increasing the base mult of the hand. Since this joker will consume the Enhancements before they get applied, hands with a high base mult are preferred. Vampire combos well with jokers that either generate Tarot Cards, or enhancements themselves (such as Midas Mask) to generate a steady supply of Enhancements to eat. If using the Midas Mask combo, the order will affect this. If the Midas Mask is placed first, face cards will be changed to gold cards, and the Vampire will immediately consume the effect to increase its multiplier. However, if the Midas Mask is placed after the Vampire, the cards are made golden without consuming the effect. Thus, players could create infinite enhancement supplies for Vampire either by having Midas Mask turn face cards to Gold first then Vampire consumes them, or have some Gold Cards in advance and have Vampire consume them, and they immediately turns into Gold Cards again by Midas Mask. Jokers such as DNA or Marble Joker also provide a good source of Enhancements (as you can play a single enhanced card with DNA before Vampire to copy it with its enhancement before feeding the Vampire). Splash is a useful supporting Joker that guarantee five enhanced cards to be scored, in the event that they can't form a five-card hands. A second Vampire cannot scale at the same time as the first, as only the left-most of the two will scale. To get the best score possible, it is recommended to try to keep them at the same Mult, by swapping them around. Vampire requires a large amount of enhanced cards to scale, therefore consumables that adds enhancement are important to scale this Joker fast. Tarot cards like The Magician, The Empress and The Hierophant are preferred as they enhance up to 2 cards at once. The Lovers, The Chariot, The Devil, Justice, and The Tower are good alternate pick up that enhance 1 card. Death can be used to duplicate an enhanced card as well. Spectral cards that adds enhanced cards to your deck like Familiar, Grim, and Incantation are useful to increase enhanced cards number, but be wary that they could also destroy an enhanced card in your hand as well.

Vampire removes Enhancements before their effect occurs, meaning the Enhancements cannot activate. All scored cards will get their Enhancements removed. Vampire also cannot change the type of Poker Hand retroactively, for example removing Wild would still keep the Poker Hand as Flush. There are a few notable interactions: Due to the need of constantly finding enhanced cards to feed the Vampire, the Zodiac Deck, Magic Deck or the Black Deck will work well for the vampire.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number).

Stickers can be Stake Stickers, indicating previous wins with this Joker/Deck, or they can be one of three in-run stickers that have a direct effect on the Joker during the run. The player cannot manually apply or remove any Stickers. If a Sticker is applied, it will be shown in the top corner of the card or deck (right if Stake Stickers, left otherwise). A Joker or Deck may only show a single Stake Sticker on it at any time, but can have multiple in-run stickers. Jokers can have an Edition and one or more Stickers at the same time. Eternal StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Black Stake and higher runs have a 30% chance of getting the Eternal Sticker. These Jokers cannot be sold, nor can they be destroyed by any means, making any Eternal Joker a permanent addition to your build. Eternal Jokers can be found in shops and booster packs with a 30% chance of occurring for each Joker. Some Challenge Decks also make use of Eternal Jokers. The indestructibility of Eternal Jokers creates some strategies that are exclusive to Black stake and higher. For example, if Madness is present on a build that consists solely of Eternal Jokers, it will gain its x0.5 Mult without being able to destroy any Jokers, turning it into a risk-free scaler. (However, Ceremonial Dagger's Mult is only added once it destroys a Joker, so it cannot be used in the same way.) Eternal Jokers can also remove or mitigate the downside of Spectral Cards that destroy Jokers, namely Hex and Ankh. A Joker cannot have both the Eternal and Perishable Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with an Eternal Sticker unless forced to by certain Challenge Decks. Jokers that self-destruct or activate on sell cannot receive the Eternal Sticker, which includes the following 11 Jokers:Perishable StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Orange and Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting Perishable Sticker. These Jokers last for five rounds, and become Debuffed afterward. A Debuffed Joker no longer provides any of its original buff nor edition, but still provides passive effects to other Jokers, such as increasing sell value with Gift Card, providing +3 Mult for Abstract Joker or adding its sell value to Swashbuckler or Temperance. A Joker cannot have both the Perishable and Eternal Sticker at the same time. Legendary Jokers will never appear with a Perishable Sticker. Most non-retroactive positively scaling Jokers (i.e. Jokers with an effect that gradually increases only while the Joker is held) cannot receive the Perishable sticker, which includes the following 18 Jokers:Rental StickerJokers found in the shop or booster packs during Gold Stake runs have a 30% chance of getting the Rental Sticker. These Jokers cost $1 to purchase, but deduct $3 at the end of every round. This price is deducted before the round payout, meaning that it can lower your interest. If you have less than $3 when a Rental Joker activates, you will be put into debt. Because Rental Jokers cost $1 up-front and sell for $1, they are effectively free if sold before the end of your next round, creating some strategies that are exclusive to Gold stake. Rental Jokers that create value in the shop (such as Hallucination or Chaos the Clown, on blind select (such as Cartomancer) or during a blind (such as Mail-In Rebate) can be purchased, then sold before the end of a round for free value. Additionally, the ability to buy and sell a Joker for no effective cost creates free scaling for Campfire. A Rental Joker can also have an Eternal or Perishable Sticker. All Jokers can receive the Rental Sticker, although Legendary Jokers will never appear with one. Since Jokers can't be both Eternal and Perishable, there is a 40% chance (100% − 30% − 30%) of a Joker being clean of both on Orange and Gold Stakes. There is also a 70% chance (100% − 30%) of not having a Rental sticker on Gold Stake, leading to a combined 28% chance (40% × 70%) of a Joker having no in-run stickers.[1] There are eight different Stake Stickers. They are normally not visible on Jokers or Decks during a run, but Joker Stake Stickers can be viewed by enabling the \"Display Stake Stickers during Run\" option in the game settings. The Stickers can also be found on Jokers and Decks in their respective section of the Collection menu, as well as on decks in the \"New Run\" menu. Only the highest Sticker (from the most difficult stake) obtained on a Joker/Deck is shown. Getting a certain Sticker will also automatically unlock all the Stickers below it. A Joker will gain the Sticker corresponding to the Stake of the run, once you beat Ante 8 with this Joker equipped. Jokers that were sold or destroyed before seeing the summary screen or Jokers bought after Ante 8 will not receive a Sticker, but debuffed Jokers do receive Stickers.

There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers. Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can be spawned with Negative modifier with the Legendary Joker Perkeo. Vouchers can never have any modifiers. Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten. In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop. Debuffed cards (from Boss Blinds) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert to their original suit.

See Stickers for more information about Eternal, Perishable and Rental modifiers on Jokers. When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers. See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers. The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers.

For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money. An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played. The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated. Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money. Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example: Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once. Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them: Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32. Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on). An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here. Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes. In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (1.8e308), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have \"completed\" or \"beaten\" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39. A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

It gets increasingly bad over the course of any run which is upgrading hand types, as the +Mult slowly gets outscaled by the base Mult of the hand. Other Jokers that require playing hands containing Three of a Kind, such as Wily Joker and The Trio work well to accentuate its effect. In particular, combining it with Wily Joker allows any level one Three of a Kind to get a minimum of 130 Chips and 15 Mult, allowing it to beat all of Antes 1 and 2 on lower stakes, and Ante 3 with the bare minimum support (or playing Full House/Four of a Kind). This gives more opportunity to find better Jokers or begin scaling Jokers that are weak initially."},{"url":"https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Zany_Joker_(Joker)","title":"Zany Joker","content":"Can work well with the Ghost Deck (several spectral cards can greatly increase the odds of getting X of a kind) and Abandoned Deck (which by virtue of its smaller starting deck size has an easier time getting X of a kind) Works best when focusing on a Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Five of a Kind, or Full House build. General goal should be increasing the odds of seeing many copies of a given rank. It's worth noting that this is not a particularly strong joker, even in decks which can benefit from its +12 Mult with multiple hands per round.
