✅ YES — With Caveats

This pattern is viable, and commonly used in Rust projects that need:

Shared, mutable, long-lived entities.

Interior mutability (e.g. for ECS-like or simulation structures).

Borrow checker peace ✌️ across multiple systems/modules.

BUT... you need to wrap the cards themselves, not just the deck.

🔧 Refactored Version
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

pub struct GameState {
    pub deck: Rc<RefCell<Deck>>,
}

pub struct Deck {
    pub deck_type: DeckType,
    pub cards: Vec<Rc<RefCell<Card>>>, // 👈 Key Change
}

pub struct Card {
    pub id: u32,
    pub name: String,
    pub power: i32,
    // etc...
}


Now:

Each Card is wrapped in Rc<RefCell<>>

You can pass around Rc<RefCell<Card>> to different systems

Each system can borrow() or borrow_mut() that card as needed

No double borrowing issues if you follow the borrow rules

🧠 Why This Works

You can clone an Rc to share ownership of a Card.

You can mutate a card at any time with card.borrow_mut().

All mutation is tracked at runtime via RefCell.

No copying of Card values — just cheap pointer/reference passing.

Example usage:

fn buff_card(card: Rc<RefCell<Card>>, amount: i32) {
    card.borrow_mut().power += amount;
}

⚠️ Caveats You Should Consider
1. 🔄 Nested Borrowing Complexity

Avoid patterns like:

let deck = state.deck.borrow();        // Immutable borrow of deck
let card = deck.cards[0].borrow_mut(); // 🔥 Runtime panic if trying to mutate while deck is borrowed


Instead:

let card = {
    let deck = state.deck.borrow();
    deck.cards[0].clone()
}; // deck borrow ends here

card.borrow_mut().power += 5; // ✅ Safe

2. ♻️ Avoid Memory Leaks

If you make circular Rc references, like Card pointing back to Deck, you'll leak memory.

✅ Use Weak<RefCell<T>> for back-references:

pub struct Card {
    pub parent_deck: Weak<RefCell<Deck>>, // no ownership cycle
    // ...
}

3. 💡 RefCell Panics at Runtime

Never double-mutate:

let a = card.borrow_mut();
let b = card.borrow_mut(); // ❌ panic


Use good control flow and scoping to avoid this.

🧘 Recommendation from the Samurai

✅ Use Rc<RefCell<Card>> in Vec if:

You want long-lived, individually mutable cards

Cards are passed to multiple systems

You’re not doing this in a multi-threaded context (or use Arc<Mutex<T>>)

This design:

Keeps ownership clean

Avoids cloning card data

Keeps the borrow checker happy

🧪 Example in Action
fn draw_card(deck: Rc<RefCell<Deck>>) -> Option<Rc<RefCell<Card>>> {
    deck.borrow_mut().cards.pop()
}

fn damage_card(card: Rc<RefCell<Card>>, damage: i32) {
    let mut card = card.borrow_mut();
    card.power -= damage;
}


And in main or your game loop:

let card = draw_card(game_state.deck.clone()).unwrap();
damage_card(card.clone(), 3);

🔚 TL;DR

✅ Yes, using Rc<RefCell<Card>> inside your deck is totally viable in single-threaded games.
✅ This pattern gives you safe shared mutability, and avoids copying large Card objects.
⚠️ Just watch for:

Nested borrowing (scope your borrows well)

Memory leaks (use Weak if needed)

Runtime panics (manage RefCell carefully)
